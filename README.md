## Overview:

Northroot is the open canonical repository
for policy enforced AI execution.

## Who it is for:

  - teams who need enforcement at the execution boundary,
    where autonomous sytems may touch money, sensitive data,
    and/or take side effectful actions in the world.

  - teams requiring customizeable primitives
    for deployment inside their own infra
    without vendor lock in.

  - teams inside regulated environemtnes who require
    audit-grade PROOF as oppossed to best effort logging. 

## Core features:

  - deterministic canonical hashing and replay
  - policy boundaries for intent > authorization > execution > verdict
  - model, tool, framework agnosticism.
  - spend / decision caps with customizeable policy primitives
  - audit grade, append only receipts w offline verification
  - an open source gateway that can be run inside your own infra
  - a simple cli to show and verify receipts.

## What Northroot IS:
  - A neutral governance and verifiability substrate
    for bounded, side effectful AI actions.
    
  - A reference implemnentation that can be extended via adapters.

  - An early attempt at enforceable policy at the boundary rather than
    best effort logs.

## What Northroot is NOT:

  - A mass market AI gateway
  - An agent orchestrator / framework
  - Another logging system
  - an OPA / Rego Clone
  - An AI obersvability tool.
